            Able to keep her allies supplied with mana as she slows down enemies
            to ensure a kill, Crystal Maiden is a helpful addition to any team.
          </h5>
          <p>
            Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older sister Lina,
            Rylai the Crystal Maiden soon found that her innate elemental
            affinity to ice created trouble for all those around her.
            Wellsprings and mountain rivers froze in moments if she stopped to
            rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten by frost, and fruiting
            orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing down, spoiled.
            When their exasperated parents packed Lina off to the equator, Rylai
            found herself banished to the cold northern realm of Icewrack, where
            she was taken in by an Ice Wizard who had carved himself a hermitage
            at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After long study, the wizard
            pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her to take his
            place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand
            years. Her mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that
            time, and now her skills are unmatched.

          <p>
            As a grunt in the Army of Red Mist, Mogul Khan set his sights on the
            rank of Red Mist General. In battle after battle he proved his worth
            through gory deed. His rise through the ranks was helped by the fact
            that he never hesitated to decapitate a superior. Through the seven
            year Campaign of the Thousand Tarns, he distinguished himself in
            glorious carnage, his star of fame shining ever brighter, while the
            number of comrades in arms steadily dwindled. On the night of
            ultimate victory, Axe declared himself the new Red Mist General, and
            took on the ultimate title of 'Axe.' But his troops now numbered
            zero. Of course, many had died in battle, but a significant number
            had also fallen to Axe's blade. Needless to say, most soldiers now
            shun his leadership. But this matters not a whit to Axe, who knows
            that a one-man army is by far the best.

            The western forests guard their secrets well. One of these is
            Lyralei, master archer of the wood, and favored godchild of the
            wind. Known now as Windranger, Lyralei's family was killed in a
            storm on the night of her birth--their house blown down by the gale,
            contents scattered to the winds. Only the newborn survived among the
            debris field of death and destruction. In the quiet after the storm,
            the wind itself took notice of the lucky infant crying in the grass.
            The wind pitied the child and so lifted her into the sky and
            deposited her on a doorstep in a neighboring village. In the years
            that followed, the wind returned occasionally to the child's life,
            watching from a distance while she honed her skills. Now, after many
            years of training, Windranger fires her arrows true to their
            targets. She moves with blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind
            ever at her back. With a flurry of arrows, she slaughters her
            enemies, having become, nearly, a force of nature herself.

          </h5>
          <p>
            At the base of the Bleeding Hills stretches a thousand-league wood,
            a place called The Hoven, where black pools gather the tarry blood
            of the uplands, and the king-mage Sutherex sits in benevolent rule.
            Once a sworn protector of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a
            reputation for his skill with a bow. In the three-hundredth year of
            the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from sixth hell to lay
            claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decreed an
            unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life
            Without End. Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle,
            defending his lands against the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz
            drove Maraxiform back to the gates of sixth-hell itself, where on
            that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal conflict. Grievously
            wounded, the demon let out a blast of hellfire as Clinkz loosed his
            final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as hellfire poured out
            across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz alive
            at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took
            effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving
            him in this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage,
            caught in the very act of dying, carrying hell's breath with him on
            his journey into eternity.
